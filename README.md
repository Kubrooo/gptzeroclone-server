# GPTZeroClone Server

This repository contains the backend server for a GPTZero clone application. It is a lightweight REST API built with Node.js and Express, designed to receive text input and return an analysis.

This server is intended to be the backend component that powers a front-end application, handling the logic for text processing and analysis.

## Features

* A simple REST API endpoint for text analysis
* Built with Node.js and Express for reliable performance
* Includes CORS middleware to allow requests from different origins (e.g., a front-end web app)
* Uses dotenv for easy environment variable management
* Lightweight and ready for containerization or deployment

## Technologies Used

* Node.js
* Express.js
* cors (Node.js CORS middleware)
* dotenv (Loads environment variables from .env file)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

You must have Node.js (which includes npm) or Yarn installed on your machine.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kubrooo/gptzeroclone-server.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd gptzeroclone-server
```

Install dependencies:

Using Yarn (recommended, based on yarn.lock):

```bash
yarn install
```

Or using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the necessary configuration:

```
# Port the server will run on
PORT=8080

# Add any other required API keys or configuration here
# EXAMPLE_API_KEY=your_secret_key
```

### Running the Server

Once installed, you can start the development server:

Using Yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

Or using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

The server should now be running locally at `http://localhost:8080` (or the port you specified).

## API Endpoints

### Check Text

Analyzes a provided block of text to determine its origin (e.g., AI-generated or human-written).

**URL:** `/api/check`
**Method:** `POST`
**Description:** Receives text and returns an analysis.

**Request Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "text": "This is a sample text that needs to be analyzed by the server to check if it was generated by AI."
}
```

**Example Success Response (JSON):**

*(Note: The actual response structure will depend on your implementation in `checkController.js`.)*

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "aiProbability": 0.92,
  "message": "Analysis complete."
}
```
